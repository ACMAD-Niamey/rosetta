"""Reduce a gridded field to one value per district with rosetta.zonal.

Requires the geo extra: pip install 'accord-rosetta[geo]'

fetch(region=shp) dissolves a shapefile's features into ONE mask and answers
"give me the data over this area". Reporting asks the other question — "give me
one number PER district" — which is what zonal() answers: it rasterizes all the
geometries once and reduces the grid with a single groupby, so a thousand
woredas cost one pass, not a thousand.

# Notes / gotchas:
# - CHIRPS dekads are 0.05-degree, so most woredas cover many cells. On a COARSE
#   grid a district smaller than one cell captures no cell centre and yields NaN
#   — pass all_touched=True to include every touched cell.
# - all_touched=True can make coverage WORSE where districts share a boundary:
#   rasterize is last-one-wins, so a shared boundary cell goes to whichever
#   feature burned last. Use it for the small/coarse case, not reflexively.
# - NaN cells are excluded from the reduction: a half-ocean district is averaged
#   over its land only.
# - The output keeps every non-spatial dim (here `time`), so it drops straight
#   into anything that reduces along time (e.g. accumulation curves).
