"""Fetch issuance-keyed CHIRPS-GEFS short-range forecasts.

CHIRPS-GEFS products carry an `issuance` catalog block: they are addressed by
issuance DATE, not by season. No credentials, but they live on CHC's UCSB server
behind CrowdSec — the catalog pins request_interval: 3.0 (a 4-hour IP ban waits
above ~2 req/s).

# - 2020 is deliberately absent from chc/chirps-gefs-daily (hindcast 2001-2019,

# - Aggregate the daily product to dekads/pentads downstream rather than fetching
#   CHC's separate dekad forecast, which is keyed by target dekad, not issuance.
