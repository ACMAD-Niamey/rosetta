"""Assemble a multi-model roster into deepscale-ready arrays.

assemble() fans out over fetch() with year_index=True and returns
{label: (hindcast, forecast)} where each DataArray is (year, member, lat, lon)
with a guaranteed member dim — the exact shape deepscale's methods consume
(they call hindcast.mean("member")).
