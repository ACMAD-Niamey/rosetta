    init names the forecast issuance. Seasonal products take a month
    ("2026-07"); sub-seasonal and short-range ones take a day ("2026-07-05").
    Issuance-keyed products (whose catalog entry has an `issuance` block) also
    accept a *sequence* of dates, which is how you fetch the same calendar
    issuance of many years for a hindcast-skill analysis:

        rosetta.fetch("chc/chirps-gefs-daily", "precip",
                      init=[f"{y}-06-30" for y in range(2001, 2020)],
                      region="ethiopia.shp")

    The result is stacked on init_time, with lead_time and valid_time coords.

    months restricts an observational fetch to those calendar months, e.g.
    months=[6, 7, 8, 9] for a JJAS analysis. For products stored one file per
    (year, month) this prunes the *download*, not just the result: a four-month
    season over 45 years is 180 files rather than 540. Against a rate-limited
    server that is the difference between a pull and a ban.

    region accepts a bbox [lat_s, lat_n, lon_w, lon_e], a path to a .shp
    shapefile, or a shapely / geopandas geometry. For shapefiles and geometries
    the bounding box drives upstream slicing and the result is masked to the
    true polygon (cells outside it become NaN). Shapefile/geometry support
    needs the `geo` extra: pip install 'accord-rosetta[geo]'.

    boundary selects which grid cells count as inside the region, for both bbox
    and shapefile/geometry inputs:
      "center" (default): keep a cell only if its centre lies inside the region
        — the xarray/CDO/rasterio convention, and unbiased for area means.
      "cover": keep every cell the region touches, so it's covered to its true
        edges (matches rasterio's all_touched=True). Best for display/masking
        and small or coarse-grid regions.

    region_buffer (degrees, default 1.5): only used when boundary="cover". How
    far to pad the fetched bbox so boundary cells aren't clipped off before the
    region is covered. Must exceed half the grid spacing (1.5° covers grids up
    to ~3°); raise it for coarser products.

    cache=True (default): results are cached locally via nuthatch.
    cache=False: bypass the cache and fetch fresh from the source.

    allow_partial=False (default): adapters that fetch multiple files raise
    if any requested file fails, so partial results never reach the cache or
    downstream metrics. Set True to opt into best-effort behaviour (returns
    whatever subset succeeded). Currently honoured by the HTTP adapter.

    max_retries / retry_backoff: per-file retry budget for transient fetch
    failures (rate-limit responses, network blips). Each retry waits
    retry_backoff * 2**attempt seconds with jitter. Set max_retries=0 to
    disable. Currently honoured by the HTTP adapter.

    request_interval: minimum seconds between successive file opens (shared
    across worker threads). Use this to stay under a server's
    requests-per-second budget. Default 0 = no pacing. Currently honoured by
    the HTTP adapter. A product may declare its own request_interval (and a
    max_workers concurrency cap) in the catalog as a safety floor; this kwarg
    can raise that floor but not lower it. The native CHIRPS entries set one so
    bulk pulls stay under the UCSB CrowdSec rate ban — raise it further for
    large regional domains (rule of thumb: range-reads-per-file / 2 seconds).

    reforecast: when True, fetch the reforecast (hindcast) suite associated
    with the given issuance instead of the forecast itself. Currently
    honoured by the CDS adapter's s2s-forecasts branch.

    seasonal=None (default): no seasonal aggregation. seasonal="mean" subsets
    the `target` season's months on the `time` dim and averages them to one
    value per year (dim `time` -> `year`). No-op for data vars that have no
    `time` dim (e.g. year_index=True results, already lead-averaged). Requires
    `target`. Within-year seasons (e.g. MAM) are labelled by their calendar
    year. Wraparound seasons that cross the calendar-year boundary (NDJ, DJF)
    are labelled by the year of their starting month (so DJF Dec YYYY + Jan/Feb
    YYYY+1 -> year YYYY, matching how a wraparound forecast target is labelled
    by its initialization year); the wrapped months are shifted back a year
    before grouping, and incomplete seasons at the ends of the record (missing
    one or more of the season's months) are dropped.

    grid_res=None (default): no regridding. grid_res=<float> interpolates
    onto a regular lat/lon grid at that resolution spanning `region`
    (np.arange(lat_s, lat_n + grid_res/2, grid_res), same for lon). Requires
    `region`. Mutually exclusive with `regrid_to`.

    regrid_to=None (default): no regridding. regrid_to=<xr.DataArray>
    interpolates onto that DataArray's lat/lon coordinates. Mutually
    exclusive with `grid_res`.
